    <p>I am currently 15 and a junior at Akins High School. In school, I have taken three computer science courses, 
    as well as being a part of the Code2College program. I have studied HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where I have
    worked with math functions, gpdraw, and jQuery, building classes and writing functions.

    In my free time, I enjoy doing martial arts, playing my instrument, and reading. I have been in the same karate
    studio for almost 10 years, and I am a 2nd degree black belt. I have been playing trombone for 6 years, and have 
    been in the top ensemble at Akins since my freshman year. I have consistently maintained all A's in school, and 
    am in the top 10 of my class.</p>
